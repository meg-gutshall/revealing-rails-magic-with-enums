# Let's Back It Up

## Ruby

> "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be **happy**. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language."
>
> â€” Matz

Ruby was created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto and publicly released in 1995. It is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

## Rails

Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. It is opinionated software that encourages **The Rails Way**.

The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:

- **Don't Repeat Yourself**
- **Convention Over Configuration**

<!--
RAILS

"The Rails Way" makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and encourages that through a set of conventions. Adopting these conventions allows you to write less code while simultaneously boosting productivity.

Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.
Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.
