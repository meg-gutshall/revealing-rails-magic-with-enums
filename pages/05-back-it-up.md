# Let's Back It Up

## Active Record as an ORM Framework

Active Record allows us to...

- Represent models and their data
- Represent associations between these models
- Represent inheritance hierarchies through related models
- Validate models before they get persisted to the database
- Perform database operations in an object-oriented fashion

_\*ORM = Object Relational Mapping_
