# Traversing the Source Code

- Think of it as one giant stack trace
- It takes some getting used to, bit GitHub provides some helpful tools
  - The collapsible file tree on the left
  - Symbol definition on the right
  - Slash command (`/`) search automatically set to the current repo/org/user scope
