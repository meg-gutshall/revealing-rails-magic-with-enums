# RTFD!!

## Ahem... I mean, search the documentation ðŸ˜‡

<!--
Navigate to https://api.rubyonrails.org/ and search "enum". Select ActiveRecord::Enum result and show the documentation. It's everything we covered earlier, nothing we don't already know â€“ blah, blah, blah â€“ how does it WORK??

Scroll to the bottom where we'll find the `enum` method listed. Click "show" next to source for the mini-preview. Then click "on GitHub" to navigate to the source code.
