title: Revealing Rails Magic with Enums
info: |
  "Rails magic" is a term many people use to describe the ease with which Rails helps you go from zero to working app so quickly. However, like all other frameworks, thereâ€™s no magic to be found â€“ only code!

  In this talk, youâ€™ll get a peek behind the curtain as we break down the ActiveRecord Enums module. Youâ€™ll learn what it is, how/when to use it, and some cool tricks it provides. Even if youâ€™re not a Rails developer, you will still come away from this talk with new-found knowledge on how to traverse a codebase and gain a better understanding of features built into your language of choice.
